# wxs_characters
The first "first party" module for the WXS Framework - a way to interact with multicharacters

## What is this
Since multicharacters is integrated in the wxs framework, this is a module that takes use of that. Currently it's got a **very ugly** UI i just threw together with Foact.

## Current Features
- See characters
- Create Character
- Load character & spawn at last location and heading

## Where to find the framework?
https://github.com/Walter-Xean-Scripts/wxs_framework <- there!
